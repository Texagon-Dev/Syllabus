# MVC Architecture - Backend

## Introduction

This README explains the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture pattern with respect to implementing the backend of a web application.

MVC is a software design pattern that separates code into three interconnected components - the Model, the View, and the Controller. Each component has distinct responsibilities and together they interact to create the full application.

## Model

The Model manages the data, business logic, and rules of the application. On the backend, this includes:

- Defining data models and schema using ORM tools like Mongoose, SQLAlchemy, etc.
- Implementing business logic for data operations - validation, computations, workflows, etc.
- Interacting with the database through the ORM for CRUD operations.
- Encapsulating core functionality and data access.

## Controller

The Controller handles request routing and application logic. On the backend, this involves:

- Receiving HTTP requests from the frontend and routing them appropriately. 
- Interacting with the Model to query or manipulate data as needed.
- Formatting API responses, usually into JSON format.
- Handling request parameters, headers, cookies, etc.
- Exposing backend APIs and logic to the frontend.

## View 

The View renders the final output representation of the data. On the backend, this refers to:

- Server-side templates like Pug, EJS to build HTML views.
- Dynamically injecting model data into templates before rendering.
- Rendering final HTML, JSON output to send in HTTP responses.

## Summary

In summary, the backend MVC separation allows:

- The Model and Controller to handle the core logic 
- The View to format responses for the frontend
- Loose coupling between the components
- Easier maintenance and testing

MVC enables building a structured, organized backend codebase.
