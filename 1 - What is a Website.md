# Website

A website is a collection of web pages and related resources that are accessible through a web browser over the internet. It is typically designed to provide information, services, or interactive content to users. A website comprises several key components, including the frontend, backend, and database, each with distinct roles and responsibilities:

# Frontend:
          # User Interface (UI): 
                                The frontend is the user-facing part of a website that users interact with directly. It consists of web pages, layouts, and user interfaces designed to present information and enable user interactions.
HTML/CSS/JavaScript: Frontend developers use HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for structuring content, CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for styling, and JavaScript for adding interactivity and dynamic behavior to web pages.
UI Frameworks and Libraries: Frontend developers often utilize UI frameworks and libraries like React, Angular, Vue.js, or Bootstrap to streamline the development of responsive and visually appealing user interfaces.
Client-Side Routing: Managing client-side routing for single-page applications (SPAs) to enable smooth navigation without full page reloads
